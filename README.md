# Random Image Generator (RIG)

RIG is a byproduct from my [previous project](https://github.com/HardcoreMagazine/Enlashceoc), 
discovered by accident during creation of maze generation algorithm.  
RIG allows you to create random abstract images, just like this one:

*Please note that this algorithm is highly unstable and it may take a while until you get clear 
picture instead of random mess.*
